`Curtain` is a swift pod that helps you implementing a nice background animation for your timer.
Really easy to implement, use the available options to customize the background color, the background filling direction, and the exit animation.

## Example

Use `Curtain` to animate your timer. Customize your exit animation and background color to make the user experience way better. Use it in two different direction: vertical or horizontal.

## Installation

### CocoaPods

`Curtain` is available through [CocoaPods](http://cocoapods.org). To install
it, simply add the following line to your Podfile:

```bash
pod 'Curtain'
```

### Carthage

[Carthage](https://github.com/Carthage/Carthage) is a decentralized dependency manager that builds your dependencies and provides you with binary frameworks.

To integrate Curtain into your Xcode project using Carthage, specify it in your `Cartfile`:

```ogdl
github "igorsquadra/Curtain"
```

Run `carthage update --platform iOS` to build the framework and drag the built `Curtain.framework` into your Xcode project. 

On your application targets‚Äô ‚ÄúBuild Phases‚Äù settings tab, click the ‚Äú+‚Äù icon and choose ‚ÄúNew Run Script Phase‚Äù and add the Framework path as mentioned in [Carthage Getting started Step 4, 5 and 6](https://github.com/Carthage/Carthage/blob/master/README.md)


## Usage
To implement  `Curtain` create a `BackgroundProgressView` and add it as subview.

```swift
import Curtain

// Initialize the progress view.
var backgroundProgressView: BackgroundProgressView!
backgroundProgressView = BackgroundProgressView.init(frame:
    CGRect.init(
        x: 0,
        y: 0,
        width: 0,
        height: 0
))

// Add it as subview.
view.addSubview(backgroundProgressView)
```

Use `setup` method to customize following parameters:

```swift
// Setup your progress view.
backgroundProgressView.setup(
    withDirection: .vertical, // Direction type should be .horizontal or .vertical.
    withTime: 15.0,
    view: view.frame,
    color: UIColor.init(red: 109/255, green: 212/255, blue: 0/255, alpha: 1.0),
    initialSize: 0, // Set initial size, default is 0.
    autoreset: true, // If false the progress view remains full at the end of timer.
    resetType: .linear // The reset animation should be .linear or .fade
)
```

Call `start` method to start the animation. Use `time` parameters to start the animation with a new time (if `nil` the used time is the one passed in the `setup` method).

```swift
// Start progress animation
backgroundProgressView.start(withTime: 35.0)
```

With `reset` method the progress view will be resetted animated.

```swift
// Reset progress animation
backgroundProgressView.reset()
```
